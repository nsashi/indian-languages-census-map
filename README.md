# Indian Languages US Census Map
[Built on the US Census API's American Community Survey 2009-13 Dataset](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/language-stats.html)<br>

* Created a 50-state map visualizing speaker statistics on 17 major Indian languages across the United States.
* Used Leaflet library to render dynamic mobile-friendly JavaScript map with React front end.
* This data is pretty underutilized and powerful, covering 380 languages/language groups. It's a unique window into the Indian-American/South Asian-American community.<br><br>
**Tech Stack: JavaScript (React), React-Bootstrap, Lodash, Leaflet, React-Leaflet, Census API**
